        <h2 class="sub-heading">About Predis AI</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Predis is an AI marketing tool for social media helping businesses make captivating Video and Image content and get AI-powered content analysis. Predis.ai is an AI/ML-based product that predicts an Instagram post’s performance before it is posted, so influencers and brands improve their posts ex-ante, using the AI’s suggestions. These suggestions include time/day of posting, caption length and image improvements. Predis also suggests hashtags for your target audience to help improve the post's reach. Through Predis, you can also carry out comprehensive competitor analysis to gauge the kind of content that performs well for them.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Fantastic AI Writing Assistant For Social Media Post & Ads</h2>
        <p class="post-text">It's been really great so far. It has helped me decrease the amount of time I need to research a niche or product I'm unfamiliar with because the outlines are really detailed. I'm also saving a lot of time in creating social media creatives because a lot of the time, the images generated by Predis.ai are useable as-is.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">PROS</h2>
        <p class="post-text">I really like the ability to generate outlines and writing guidelines for social media captions, posts, and copy. It can even help with generating outlines for ad copy. One thing that makes it stand out from the other AI writing tools is that it helps with creating images to go with the captions/copy, which you can use for inspiration.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">CONS</h2>
        <p class="post-text">It's not useful for all niches and languages. I'm hoping they improve the model so that I can use it for a broader range of products, niches, and languages.</p>       
        <h2 class="sub-heading">REASON FOR CHOOSING PREDIS.AI</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Ocoya's a really good tool, but I was looking for a stand-alone AI writing assistant with a secondary social scheduling function. Ocoya is a social scheduler first and AI writer second so that didn't fit my needs.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">REASONS FOR SWITCHING TO PREDIS.AI</h2>
        <p class="post-text">WriteSonic's another fantastic product but Predis.ai algorithm is a lot more robust. Predis more complex to work with than WriteSonic, but that's what I expect from something more powerful. You can't expect a tool to be more powerful and simpler at the same time.</p>
